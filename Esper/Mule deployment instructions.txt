1) Unzip IoT-security-simulator-Anypoint-Windows-AnypointStudio-6.5.2 on your computer, for example in C:\Mule.

2) Run Mule: C:\Mule\AnypointStudio-6.5.2\AnypointStudio.exe

3) Import the Mule project network-security.zip (DO NOT unzip): 
To do this, open Anypoint Studio: File > Import > Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)

4) Execute the imported project by clicking on the green Play button, or by right-clicking on the project and selecting Run As > Mule Application.

5) Wait for the Mule console to indicate that the project has been successfully "deployed".  

6) Start the data simulator in a Windows console: 
python IoT-security-simulator IoT-security-simulatorversion2.py

7) Once the simulator is started, copy the file IoT-security-simulator "IoT-security-simulator.epl" in the directory: 
(workspace-Mule)../network-security/new-eventpattern.

8) Check that the IoT-security-simulator.epl pattern file has been moved to directory: 
(workspace-Mule)../network-security/deployed-eventpattern
and NOT to the directory:
(workspace-Mule)../network-security/incorrect-eventpattern.

9) Select an option from the simulator menu, e.g. tcp. 

10) Check that the single events have been stored in the file: 
(workspace-Mule)../network-security/event-logs

11) Check that the complex events (automatically generated by the patterns) have been stored in the file: 
(workspace-Mule)../network-security/complex-event-logs

12) If we want to make another execution, we must stop Mule (stop icon), delete the files (event-logs.txt and complex-event-logs.txt) and repeat the steps from point 4).
